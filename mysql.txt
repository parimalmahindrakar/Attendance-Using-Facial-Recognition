To install the my sql server you need to type the following command : 
'sudo apt-get install mysql-server'


After installing it just you need to type :
(for the password and all other kind of the stuff)
"sudo mysql_secure_installation"

 After that to start the mysql server you need to type the following command :
 "sudo mysql -u root"

But here is the problem that , if you do the program in python then root of the linux machine gonna give the left and right 
i.e. if you are connecting the mysql to the python directly after installing python then "access denied" error that you will get it.
So to avoid it , 

do following , 


$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> 	



Now you can happily run the program of the python.
